# Fibroblast population detection 

In this repository we will analyze the transcriptomic profiles from fibroblast from these datasets:
- Tabib et al. (2018)
- Philippeos et al. (2018)
- Sol√©-Boldo et al (2020)
- Vorstandlechner et al. (2020)
- He et al. (2020)

We show that the transcriptomic profile of each of the datasets can be almost identically mapped, considering a set of manually curated markers. In total, we detect 
three major axes (A, B, C) which replicate in most of the datasets, and 3 minor axes (D, E, F) that are replicated in up to two datasets. For each axes, several clusters are found (A1-A4, B1-B2, B1-B4).
